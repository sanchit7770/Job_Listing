Apple is the best place to do on-device machine learning, and this team sits at the heart of that discipline, interfacing with research, SW engineering, HW engineering, and products. The team builds critical infrastructure that begins with onboarding the latest machine learning architectures to embedded devices, optimization toolkits to optimize these models to better suit the target devices, machine learning compilers and runtimes to execute these models as efficiently as possible, and the benchmarking, analysis and debugging toolchain needed to improve new model iterations. This infrastructure underpins most of Apple’s critical machine learning workflows across Camera, Siri, Health, Vision, etc., and as such is an integral part of Apple Intelligence. Our group is looking for an ML Infrastructure Engineer, with a focus graph compilers and runtimes. The role entails building the world’s foremost ML graph compilation and runtime system capable of optimizing & executing ML models efficiently on Apple products and services.\n\nDescription\n\nAs an engineer in this role, you will be primarily focused on building graph compilers that optimize ML graphs coming from the most popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, MLX, etc.) to execute performantly and efficiently on Apple Silicon. The graph compiler and runtime provides out-of-the-box capability for executing ML models while also providing extensibility hooks for users to tailor specific goals. The role also has exposure to building higher level APIs and toolings to enable developers to visualize, diagnose, and debug correctness and performance issues while onboarding models to on-device deployment. We are building the first end-to-end developer experience for ML development that, by taking advantage of Apple’s vertical integration, allows developers to iterate on model authoring, optimization, transformation, execution, debugging, profiling and analysis. The ML compiler is the backbone of such infrastructure stack. The role requires understanding of ML operator primitives, common compiler optimizations (frontend/middle-end), runtimes, and system software engineering. Key responsibilities: * Define and build the on-device graph compiler, runtime, and kernels executing ML operators. * Build production-critical system software for executing ML models on Apple Silicon. * Optimize model execution for various system goals such as performance, energy efficiency, thermals, etc.\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n\nBachelors in Computer Sciences, Engineering, or related discipline.\nHighly proficient in C++. Familiarity with Python.\nFamiliarity with Operating Systems, embedding programming, parallel programming.\nExperience with any compiler stack (MLIR/LLVM/TVM/...).\nSound understanding of ML fundamentals, including common architectures such as Transformers.\nGood communication skills, including ability to communicate with cross-functional audiences.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\nExperience with any on-device ML stack, such as TFLite, ONNX, ExecuTorch, etc.\nExperience with any ML authoring framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.) is a strong plus.\nExperience with accelerators, GPU programming is a strong plus.\n\nPay & Benefits\n\nAt Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $143,100 and $264,200, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location.\n\nApple employees also have the opportunity to become an Apple shareholder through participation in Apple’s discretionary employee stock programs. Apple employees are eligible for discretionary restricted stock unit awards, and can purchase Apple stock at a discount if voluntarily participating in Apple’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. You’ll also receive benefits including: Comprehensive medical and dental coverage, retirement benefits, a range of discounted products and free services, and for formal education related to advancing your career at Apple, reimbursement for certain educational expenses - including tuition. Additionally, this role might be eligible for discretionary bonuses or commission payments as well as relocation.

  "description": "Summary\n\nPosted: Dec 13, 2024\n\nRole Number:200579714\n\nApple is where individual imaginations gather together, committing to the values that lead to great work. Every new product we build, service we create, or Apple Store experience we deliver is the result of us making each other’s ideas stronger. That happens because every one of us shares a belief that we can make something wonderful and share it with the world, changing lives for the better. It’s the diversity of our people and their thinking that inspires the innovation that runs through everything we do. When we bring everybody in, we can do the best work of our lives. Here, you’ll do more than join something - you’ll add something.
